# OS X Setup Script

This repository contains scripts that can be used to setup a brand new
OS X within minutes. It can apply os settings, install system software
and setup applications and npm packages. 



## How to use it

To trigger the setup script, run `./setup.sh [OPTION]`. If you omit an
option, you will be presented with a menu, where all available options
are presented.

`./setup.sh all` will setup the computer with everything these scripts
have to offer.
